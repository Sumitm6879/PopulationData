📜 Available Spells

npm install: 🌿 Gather the necessary herbs (node modules) for your potion. Run this spell to install all the magical ingredients your app needs.

npm start: 🎵 The grand ball begins! Imagine your app waltzing onto the dance floor at http://localhost:3000. It pirouettes gracefully, and whenever you tweak its outfit (code), it refreshes its steps automatically. 💃
Sometimes, though, it might trip over its own shoelaces (lint errors). But don’t worry; it’s just practicing its moves. 👟

npm test: 🏆 The judges are watching! Launch the test runner—it’s like a dance-off with your tests. If your app nails the routine, it gets a standing ovation. If not, well, back to the rehearsal studio! 🕺💃

npm run build: 🏰 Your app transforms into a dazzling castle fit for royalty. It’s like Cinderella getting ready for the royal ball. The build process minifies everything, adds fancy filenames with secret hashes (shh, don’t tell), and voilà! Your app is ready for deployment. 🌟

The filenames now sound like ancient prophecies: main.6a7b8c9d.js. 🗡️
